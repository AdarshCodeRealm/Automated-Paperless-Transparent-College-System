# HackFusion 2025

**Background:**
Colleges often struggle with transparency in administrative processes, student elections, fi nancial tracking, and complaint management. Manual processes lead to delays, lack of accountability, and limited student involvement. An automated, paperless system can improve efficiency, fairness, and accessibility.

**Problem:**
Current college administrative processes lack transparency, efficiency, and accessibility for students and faculty. There is no centralized digital system to manage elections, approvals, complaints, budget tracking, and student-related notifi cations.

**Proposed Solution:**
Develop a web or mobile-based platform that digitizes key administrative functions in a transparent and structured manner. The system will ensure fair elections, automated approvals, budget accountability, and anonymous complaint handling, while making key information accessible to students and faculty.
